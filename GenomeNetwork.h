GenomeNetwork.h

This class represents a network of genomes
related by how homologous they are to eachother.

The network is mad up of a set of GenomeNodes, each one represents
a different species. The nodes are connected to each other through
pointers with each pointer corresponding to a certain homology,
or degree of similarity.

Using the graph, genomes can be clustered into families based on
how related they are to each other. The clustering usis achieved using a markov-like
algorithm that removes the least homologous edges one by one until the number of clusters
is equivalent to the number predefined.

I use a clustering algorithm to cluster all of the species into 
a number of families predefined by the user.
