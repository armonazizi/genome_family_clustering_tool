findfamilies.cpp

This program takes a txt file consisting of genomes and their homology
percentage and calculates a set of families for the genomes based on their
similarity with each other. The number of clusters is defined by the user.

The input to this program is the output of genomecompare.cpp

The program works by building a network of genomes connected by their homologies.
It then performes a clustering algorithm on the network by trimming
the least relevant nodes until the defined number of clusters are present in the network.

The program returns a txt file containing a list of families and a list of
related genomes for each family.

The program takes input in the following way:

./findfamilies input_file.txt output_file.txt num_clusters

where:

input_file is a tab delimited file of genomes and homologies in the format:

GENOME1<TAB>GENOME2<TAB>HOMOLOGY_PERCENT
ecoli	salmonella	52.342
staph	strep	32.2376
...

output_file is the file to write to

and num_clusters is the final number of families.
